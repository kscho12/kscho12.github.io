# About Me
## My Interests
I really love to go on picnics and spend time outdoors! I **LOVE** a great hike with scenic views. I make sure to go on a picnic or hike at _least_ once a week, but usually end up going more times.
I also love to read and actually finished **50 books** last year! I especially love literary fiction and science fiction. Some books that stook out to me were **Stoner** by John Williams and **The Three Body Problem** by Cixen Liu. I love all books, but I think the perspective that science fiction books are especially interesting because they propose thought experiments into what the future of tech could look like.
In terms of my academic interests, I love to learn about Computer Science, but I'm also pretty intersted in Philosophy as well. Lately, a specific interst of mine is how AI is related to the environment and how we might be able to lessen the impacts of Chat GPT inquiries.

## Websites I Recommend
[Earth.org](https://earth.org/environmental-impact-chatgpt/)

This was an article done on **earth.org** about the environmental impacts of Chat GPT and Data Centers. I found it to be fascinating because it's an intersection between two topics that I've been very interested in lately. The article points out come alarming details of Chat GPT in regards to the environment and also proposes ideas on how we can lessen the strain on our resources.

[Literary Hub](https://lithub.com/a-feminist-critique-of-murakami-novels-with-murakami-himself/)

This was another article I found extremely interesting that shows an interview between two well-known and rising Japanese Authors **Haruki Murakami** and **Mieko Kawakami**. These are both authors that I have read and enjoyed and it was fascinating to hear them speak to each other and ask questions that the readers have had. A bigger critique of Murakami is hig portrayal of women in his books. He has a tendency to write one-dimensional women who are definitely written from a male's perspective. I thought that specific conversation between the two was interesting as Mieko is a woman and primarily writes about the struggles and conciousness of women.
